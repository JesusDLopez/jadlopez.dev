## 👨‍💻 About Me

I work at the intersection of bioinformatics, genetic counseling, and web development. My background in genetic counseling gives me unique insight into how genomic data affects real patients and families, while my technical skills help bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.

**Current Focus:**
- 🧬 Melanoma genetics research and bioinformatics analysis
- 📊 Building interactive scientific data visualizations
- 🎨 Creating web tools that make genomic data accessible
- 🤖 Learning Claude Code for AI-assisted development

**Background:**
- Master's in Genetic Counseling (clinical + scientific training)
- Research experience in genomics and statistics
- Self-taught web development from scratch
- Passionate about making science interactive and beautiful

## 🌟 Featured Project

<div align="center">

### 🧬 [Interactive Scientific Portfolio](https://portfolio-kodas.vercel.app)

A fully custom-built portfolio combining biological metaphors with modern web technologies. Built from scratch while learning React, Three.js, and D3.js.

**Tech Stack:** React 19 • Three.js • D3.js • Framer Motion • GSAP

**Features:**
- 🎨 3D DNA helix animations with interactive "inspect mode"
- 📊 Interactive statistical reports (hearing loss study, workshop evaluation)
- 🧬 Biological metaphors throughout (organelles, cell membranes, nucleotides)
- 🌓 Complete dark/light theme system
- 🔒 Custom password protection (built in code, not paid service)
- 📱 Fully responsive design

**Built entirely from scratch** - every component, every animation, every visualization.

## 🎓 My Learning Journey

This portfolio represents a complete learning journey from zero web development experience to building production-ready applications:

**Phase 1:** HTML, CSS, basic React → Understanding components and JSX
**Phase 2:** Advanced React → Hooks, context, routing, state management
**Phase 3:** Visualization → D3.js for data, Three.js for 3D graphics
**Phase 4:** Production → Deployment, optimization, real-world problem solving

Every line of code in my portfolio was written with intention, struggle, and learning.
