# Workflow

This is the modus operandi for any work done in this folder or project.

1. Characterize need: one sentence goal + acceptance criteria.
2. Add to backlog: create one file per action in `backlog/`.
3. Activate action: move the action file into `doing/`.
4. Create branch: `chore/`, `feat/`, or `fix/` + short slug.
5. Work: implement, run relevant checks.
6. Review: quick self-check + user sign-off if needed.
7. Commit: single focused commit (or a small set).
8. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`.
9. Pull request (optional): open PR or merge as you prefer.

Backlog
1. Sizing regression: explore where sizing is a problem, characterize it, and define a way forward.
